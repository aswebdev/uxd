<!-- TITLE: Creating Value -->
# The Problem
> How might we create enough lasting value that people will return repeatedly to meet their needs?
> How do we make our users form habits in using our product?


# The Hook Model
* Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop?
* What makes us engage with products out of sheer habit?
* Is there a pattern underlying how products hook us?

## Step 1 - The Trigger
How are people going to remember to come back?
* Internally motivated?
* Externally motivated? (email reminder or push notification)

Ask yourself:
* What triggers might apply to our personas?
* Are there any existing triggers we can build off?

## Step 2 - The Action
Three elements must happen at the same moment for a behaviour to occur:
* Motivation
* Ability
* Trigger

Ask yourself:
* Whats the minimum interaction the user needs to have with your product to get the intended reward?

## Step 3 - Variable Reward
Types of rewards:
* Rewards of the *tribe* are social affirmations
* Rewards of the *hunt* are based on finding something you want
* Rewards of the *self* deal with matery

Ask yourself:
* How do you reward the user?
* Is there interesting variety?
* What types of rewards can you offer across the three categories?


## Step 4 - Investment

* People value their own work a lot
* User generated content is *cheap* and an opportunity for people to invest in the product
* Create opportunities for people to invest, and to set up the next trigger
