<!-- TITLE: Feature Prioritisation -->

# Why is it important to prioritise features?
* It enables us to focus on what is important to the user and adds value to their experience
* Don't get distracted by every single edge case

* Can be a great way to engage clients and stakeholders in the decision making process
* Make sure voters are aligned to the problem, so a popularity contest does not ensue


# Scope creep
* Understand the important of the MVP
* Just because a stakeholder likes the idea, doesn't mean it's the best solution
