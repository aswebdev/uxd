<!-- TITLE: Basic Shapes -->

# Rectangles
* Symmertic, solid shape with parallel lines
* Does not exist in nature, it has become the symbol for civilisation itself; Think cities, houses, interiors, windows
* Used in history to setup constraints for the artist; canvases, grid systems


# Ellipse
* Smooth shape
* Found in nature; planets, raindrops, eyes
* Can comminite unity; Olympic rings, dancing in circles, round table discussions
