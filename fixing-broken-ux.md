<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Fixing Broken Ux -->


Unless developing completely new products at a startup, there is the likelihood that your organisation will have accumulated years of legacy design and development in it's products.

**Hierarchy of Effort**

Many large companies end up in a situation where they must maintain dozens, if not hundreds, of applications in their product portfolios.Users will often struggle to learn a suite of related products because of major differences in how they look and operate.

Initiatives to fix these broken experiences can be referred to as "common look and feel", or "unified online experience". Regardless of the term, the common elements represent a drive to bring consistency to a large set of products in multiple stages of development and spearheaded by a centralised internal group.

One effective approach begins with surface improvements, goes progressively deeper into structural issues and ends with a big strategic organisational shift.

**Visual Consistency and Simplification**

The lowest amount of effort is at the bottom of the pyramid so you should start there. It may be considered as being "lipstick on a pig", but simply taking a consistent visual approach will help bring many different products under a shared branding experience.

The following should be considered at this stage:

*   Excise unnecessary information
*   Unifying the Information Architecture
*   Adopting Standard Fonts, Colours & Controls

This is only a foundation, and it won't improve a poorly designed interaction, but it could dramatically increase the appearance if unity to the end user.

**Behavioural****Consistency**

A disciplined reuse of patterns instead of applying patterns ad hoc from a grab bag of widgets, and unifying the frameworks.This work entails at the very least replacing widgets in some applications. It usually also entails a decent amount of coding and testing to ensure that the revisions contribute to a consistent experience. Behavioural consistency makes it easier for the end user to learn a tool and then transfer those skills when picking up related tools. The user will only have to build a single mental model of how the applications work. This gives them confidence and enables them to pick up new products without facing a steep learning curve and without being confused about how things are done.

**Behavioural****Optimisation**

A deeper level of work is optimising behaviour and to make the applications more powerful and easier to use.

This level means evaluating the current products against the user's needs and goals and looking for ways to eliminate work and to simplify patterns. It assumes commitment to a user-centered product design, research, as well as personas and scenarios. Without these, there is no way to decide what patterns to simplify, which work to remove from the system, and what users needs to solve.

An optimised experience allows the users to perform their tasks with less work. Where possible, shift computing work to computers and judgement to humans. Mine data to see broader patterns and opportunities that allow the system to anticipate and meet any needs before they start to become issues.

The is where you do everything you can to _make the application the best it can be._ It takes a lot of work, with new interactions introduced and much code rewritten. A considerable investment of time and effort is required.

**Unified Experience Strategy**

The result of the last iteration is a set of products that do what they do best. The point of this iteration is to rethink how the suite works cohesively.
This step requires looking at the 'big picture', reevaluating the internal product silos and reconsidering the ideal workflow for individuals and between roles.

It could lead to the following:

*   Collapsing multiple products into one
*   Bridging gaps with new products
*   Eliminating redundancies in capabilities
*   Refocusing the service

The real beneficiary of this kind of stage is the end user, because the whole product strategy is user-centered. the company recognises that the product exists to help people perform their work and that they might use other tools and services to accomplish their goals.

Success should be measured by how competently users move through this complex ecosystem of people, data, devices and services. When a company brings their product line to this stage, both the organisation and the product line have been transformed.

**UX Culture**

All of the prior steps were aimed at fixing a broken user experience. By following them as an iterative path, it becomes possible to improve a broken user experience. They way to avoid having to repeat this cycle in a few years is to transform the organisation itself,

Products coming out of an engineering-orientated organisation bear the unmistakable focus on technology; services with a focus on sales deeply communicate this; and products that come out of organisations with a UX bent cannot avoid their focus on a good user experience.

If you want to consistently deliver a great user experience, you need to go deeper than applying design to just the surface. Your organisation needs to understand and commit to making user experience a core priority.

A great user experience never just happens. Understanding the user and keeping their needs as your number one priority throughout the design and development stages take deliberate effort. A shift in organisational culture takes the most effort and the longest time, but it results in the largest, most pervasive and most coherent shift - not just for the organisation and its products, but most importantly for the people who use them.
