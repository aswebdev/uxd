<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Usability Testing -->

# Why perform usability tests?
* Allows direct feedback from users as to the usability of the design
* Feedback from prototypes allows validation of assumptions before development

# Roles in usability testing

## The Facilitator
* Explain the task scenario (and then get out of the way)
* Act like a therapist, get them to elborate on what they think and feel
* Don't bias the test and tell the tester what they should be doing
* Probe the testers expectations:
	* What do you think this does?
	* What do you think it should do next?
	* Where do you think this leads to?
* Don't interfere if you can help it. Let people struggle (and possibly fail)

## The Tester
* Think out loud. It will help others understand what you're doing/not doing
* They shouldn't solution the project
* They should focus on what is happening, not how to fix it


## The note taker

# Revise
Results from a usability test may prove that changes need to be made to the prototype. Making updates to sketches and performing more interviews will assist in creating a more refined prototype.
