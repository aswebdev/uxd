<!-- TITLE: Usability Testing -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Usability Testing -->

# Why perform usability tests?
* Allows direct feedback from users as to the usability of the design
* Feedback from prototypes allows validation of assumptions before development

# Roles in usability testing

## The Facilitator
* Explain the task scenario (and then get out of the way)
* Act like a therapist, get them to elborate on what they think and feel
* Don't bias the test and tell the tester what they should be doing
* Probe the testers expectations:
	* What do you think this does?
	* What do you think it should do next?
	* Where do you think this leads to?
* Don't interfere if you can help it. Let people struggle (and possibly fail)

## The Tester
* Think out loud. It will help others understand what you're doing/not doing
* They shouldn't solution the project
* They should focus on what is happening, not how to fix it

### Tips for guiding
* "We are testing the app, we are not testing you"
* "You won't be hurting our feelings, we are looking for constructive feedback"
* "You can't do anything wrong"
* "Please think out loud"
* "I can't answer questions during the test, but I will afterwards"

## The note taker
* Take observational notes. Keep observations separate from overall insights or design solutions

# Making sense of the results
* Use affinity mapping to visualise trends in the testing observations. Solutions can be prioritised (in collaboration with stakeholders)
* Keep solutions separate from observations
* Use your judgement about what seems like an issue
* Think about what may need to be validated or tested further

# Revise
Results from a usability test may prove that changes need to be made to the prototype. Making updates to sketches and performing more interviews will assist in creating a more refined prototype.

# Reporting Usability Testing Results
## Formal Method
* Study Goals
* Methodology
* Participant Demographics
* Summaries of high level findings
* Details of meaningful findings
* Emphasis on action items

## Informal Method
Some examples may include:

* [Rainbow Spreadsheet](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/rainbow-spreadsheet-collaborative-ux-research-tool/)
* Short Summary
* Bullet Lists
* Quotes
* Audio/Video

## Group De-Brief
Demonstrate and synthesise results with team, which will assist in determining next actionable items
