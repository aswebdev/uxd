<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Usability Testing -->

# Why perform usability tests?
* Allows direct feedback from users as to the usability of the design
* Feedback from prototypes allows validation of assumptions before development

# Roles in usability testing

## The Interviewer
* Explain the task scenario (and then get out of the way)
* Act like a therapist, get them to elborate on what they think and feel

## The Tester
* Think out loud. It will help others understand what you're doing/not doing

# Revise
Results from a usability test may prove that changes need to be made to the prototype. Making updates to sketches and performing more interviews will assist in creating a more refined prototype.
