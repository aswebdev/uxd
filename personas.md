* Can assist with making design decisions, based on attitudes, goals and behaviours
* Teams can more easily form concensus by referring to personas

## Why are they important?
* Personas enable us to design for a specific person or archetype
* Having focused user will stop you for trying to design for "everyone" (creating for everyone will please no one)
