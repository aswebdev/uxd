<!-- TITLE: Focusing On The Mistakes -->

**Stop congratulating yourself**
Until you're willing to stop congratulating yourself for what's working and start looking at the misses, mistakes, errors, omissions, defects and delays that are irritating customers, de-motivating employees, and devouring your profit margins, all the lean tools will not help you.

**View every mistake as an opportunity**
Once you view every mistake as an opportunity to mistake-proof and improve the delivery of your product or service, you'll get hooked on lean. Until then, the methods and tools will just be another burden in an already crisis-managed world.
