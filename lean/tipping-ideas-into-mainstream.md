<!-- TITLE: Tipping Ideas Into Mainstream -->

There's an argument that any idea "tips" into the mainstream when sponsored by one of three informal leaders; connectors, maverns, or salespeople

**Connectors**
Connect people with other people they know. Think about your own company. WHo is the center of influence who knows everybody and introduces everyone to everyone else?

**Maverns**
Connect people with new ideas. Who is the center of influence in your company who gets everyone on board with all the new changes in technology? 

**Salespeople**
Do it all for the money. They make change happen through persuasion.
