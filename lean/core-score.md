<!-- TITLE: Choosing the right metrics: Core Score -->

**What's your core score**

Who do you serve? What do they want? How can you measure that you deliver what they want?

Measurements drive behaviour. Bad measures will drive bad behaviour. Good measures will drive good behaviour. If you aren't getting what you want from your business, adjust what you measure and how you reward it. The system will change!
