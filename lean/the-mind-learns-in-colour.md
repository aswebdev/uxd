<!-- TITLE: The Mind Learns In Colour -->

The human eye can readily detect coloue. Once the mind gets used to seeing a certain colour associated with a certain tool, product or process, the two become linked in ones mind.

**Keep in mind**
When developing a system or process, ensure that different colours are used for different categorisation. This will create a link for users and minimise process errors
