<!-- TITLE: When Data Gets Questioned -->

**Problem**
When a team member (who doesn't like implications of a particular data set) states in a congruent voice that the data is wrong and should not be used.

**Solution**
Recoginse that this member is operating on gut feel, not data. Simply ask: 
* "Okay, do you have better data?"
* "How do you know that the data is invalid?"
If there is no 'better' data that proves this is invalid, we're going to continue using this data. They are valid to get the data, but meanwhile, we're moving forward
