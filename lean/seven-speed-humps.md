<!-- TITLE: Seven Speed Humps of Lean -->

1. Over production - It creates inventories that take up space and capital
2. Excess inventory - Excess inventory caused by over production is waste
3. Waiting - Any waiting time is waste
4. Unnecessary movement of work products (i.e transportation) - Work travelling between processes is waste
5. Unnecessary movement of employees - Are employees walking too far to get supplies or deliver a work product? 
6. Unnecessary or incorrect processing - Why do things that add no value? Stop doing the unnecessary and do things right the first time
7. Defects - They lead to repair, rework and scrap
