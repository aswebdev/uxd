<!-- TITLE: Core ideas of Lean -->

1. *Determine value* - What does the customer want? Determining value, from the customer's point of view, can be a challenge for a number of reasons:
* Value is an effect of doing things right. The effects of improving speed, quality, and costs load to higher customer satisfaction, retention, and referrals. All of which lead to growth and profitablility
* What has value in one situation may not have value in another. If I want a product or service delivered on a Friday, it doesn't matter to me if you can deliver it on any of the weekdays before Friday (I want it when I want it, not when you can deliver it.)

2. *Use pull systems* - to avoid overproduction. Big inventories of raw materials or finished goods hide problems and inefficiencies

3. *Institute one-piece flow* - Make the work flow, so that there are no interruptions, wasted time, or materials

4. *Level out the workload* - to the rate of the customer demand or pull

5. *Stop and fix problems* - immediatley to get quality right the first time.

6. *Standardise* - to support improvement

7. *Use visual controls* - so that no problems remain hidden

8. *Use only reliable technology* - that supports people and the process

9. *Compete against perfection* - not competitors
