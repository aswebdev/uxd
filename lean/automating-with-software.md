<!-- TITLE: Automating With Software -->

**Asking the right questions**
It's typical for the wrong questions to be asked when automating a company or process. The conversation should change from:

"Will this software allow us to do the things the way we do them today?"

to

"Will this software allow us to do the things the way we should be doing them?"


**Getting the key benefits out of software systems**
To maximize the benefit of new IT systems, some advice to use:

1. Simplify, streamline, or reengineer the process first
2. Choose or build a system that reflects the streamlined flow, not the old flow
3. Expect each new application release to be error-prone. Use systematic problem solving to identify and remedy all of the requirements, design and coding errors. Resolve problems at their source, not necessarily where they show up
4. As your new system evolves, simplify and streamline the software to prevent the creeping complexity that will render it inflexible and unchangable
