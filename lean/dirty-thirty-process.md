<!-- TITLE: Dirty Thirty Process -->

While most software quality efforts focus on the development of software - requirements, design, code and test - this method focuses on the fine tuning of the *delivered* software. 

IT managers and app users often expect a new software project or ehancement release to be flawless, and then are stunned by the additional staffing required to stem the tide of rejected transactions (tasks).

The secret is to:

1. Quantify the cost of correcting the rejected transactions
2. Understand the pareto pattern of rejected transactions
3. Analyse 30 rejected transactions one by one to determine the root cause
4. Revise the requirements and modify the system to prevent these problems
