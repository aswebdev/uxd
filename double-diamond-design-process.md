# What is it?
The diamond diamond is a process of design problem solving. It involves exploring a number of ideas **Divergent Thinking** before narrowing down on the best ideas **Convergent Thinking**

The two diamond represent:
1. Confirming the initially assumed problem
2. Exploring and confirming a solution 

# The four stages
The process is divided into four stages

* Discovery
* Define
* Develop
* Deliver

## Discovery
A problem as initially been assumed, ideas and insights are being discovered. Some of the activities included in the discovery phase include:
* Analysing how competitors approach a similar problem
* Talk with stakeholders
* User interviews (field research and surveys)

## Define
The defintion stage is to try to make sense of all the possibilities in the discovery stage. Some of the questions to ask:
* What are the key themes or insights in the data?
* What should/can we act on first?
* What is actually the problem?
* What does success look like? How can we measure this?

Some of the activities may include:
* Card sorting
* User flows/user journey mapping
* Reframing the problem with a new defintiion

## Develop
A problem has been properly defined and the development stage explores a number of potential solutions to the problem. Concepts are created, prototyped, tested and iterated. This a process of trial and error.

Some of the acitivies may include:
* Sketching
* Mockup/Prototype development
* User testing

## Deliver
A solution is finalised, developed, produced and then launched. Taking all the previous stages into account, the solution should ensure that users and business needs are successfully met.

The delivery should ensure that relevant metrics can be measured against, so that success of the project can be known.


# Design Thinking

Similar concept to this is known as Design Thinking

![Design Thinking](/uploads/design-thinking.png "Design Thinking")

* We’re going to do things differently from how we’ve always done it before.
* We’re going to study problems before we jump to solutions.
* We’re going to treat requirements as assumptions and validate them.
* We’re going to diverge on our best ideas before picking the one that matches the solution best.
* We’re going to map the customer’s journey to see where we’ve made a mess of things.
* We’re going to build multiple prototypes and watch users interact with them, to learn what’s best.
