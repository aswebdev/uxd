# Design Decisions & Design Options

## Options
Every design system offers options. Colours can scale from black to white (e.g. $color-grey-20) and things like spacing can be referred to in options like sm, md, lg. Options answer the question, *what options do I have?* but they don't answer, *what choices do I make?*

## Decisions
A design decision is an option applied to a context. For example, 

```$color-neutral-20 = #222222;```
