# Design Decisions & Design Options

## Options
Every design system offers options. Colours can scale from black to white (e.g. $color-grey-20) and things like spacing can be referred to in options like sm, md, lg. Options answer the question, *what options do I have?* but they don't answer, *what choices do I make?*

`$color-neutral-20 = #222222;`

## Decisions
A design decision is an option applied to a context. These help designers and developers make confient decisions about what variables to use in each context.

`$background-color-dark = $color-neutral-20;`

## Architecutre of Options and Decisions
Decisions can't be made without options. Demonstrating the path from option to decision takes the ambiguity out of the system. Remeber, Options first, decisions second.
