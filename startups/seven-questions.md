<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Seven Questions -->

### 1. The engineering question
If we are truly talking about innovation the product will not be only an incremental improvement. For it to be an innovation it must be at least 10x better than what is currently available. It's only when you have a significant advantage in the technology, that you can offer transparent superiority to the customer.

### 2. The timing question
Are you entering an existing market with the product? Is it a slow moving or fast moving one? Infrastructure readiness, social norms, government regulations, established platforms and ecosystems all play a role in the timing question.

### 3. The monopoly question
Monopolies allow you to innovate, you will have cashflow to try radical things. Compeition on the other hand prevents you from innovating. A ture innovation is one that has no competition.

### 4. The people question
So much of innovation is about the quality of people and culture that you have. 

You need to ask yourself if you really have the right people working on real product innovations. Do you have the best people on your team to puruse the product to market?
