<!-- SUBTITLE: What is a creative monopoly? -->

A creative monopoly is a new product that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator. Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation and struggle for survival

## Why do people believe that competiton is healthy?
Competition is an *ideology* that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. Compeition is preached, it's nessessity internalised and as a result we trap ourselves within it. The more we compete the less we gain.

## 10x Rule of thumb
A good rule of thumb for proprietary technology is to make sure it's at least 10x better than any substitute. This willl lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less will be seen as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an overcrowded market.

## Start small and monopolise
Every startup is small at the start. Evey monopoly dominates a large share of the market. *Therefore every startup should start with a very small market.* Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: It's easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market is too big, it most certainly is.

How can I think about ways to create a creative monopoly for a product or service?
