<!-- TITLE: Storyboarding -->

## Bad Idea Party

To help initally get ideas flowing and remove any stigma towards bad ideas, look back at the [Problem Statement / Hypthesis](/defining-user-goals) and sketch the **worst** ideas on how to solve this problem.

## Good Ideas

Now start to put togther some **good** ideas. Use the bad ideas as inspiration. "Is there something that could be amazing with a few tweaks?"


## Storyboarding an idea

A storyboard is a great way to demonstrate how something might be interacted with by a user.

1. Take an idea and expand it into a series of steps on how it might be used
2. Make a series of images with text to explain whats happening
