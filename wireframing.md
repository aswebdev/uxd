<!-- TITLE: Wireframing -->

# Whats a wireframe?
* Schematic diagrams designed for communication
* Is a representation of the kinds of content seen on website or app
* Give an overall sense of how all parts of the product hang together
* Communicate functionality, not necessarily visual layout

A wireframe will bring together:
* Structure
* Navigation
* Information Heirarchy
* Interactions

Its the step between the _sketch_ and the _prototype_
