<!-- TITLE: Synthesising User Research & Affinity Mapping -->

# How did your interview findings relate to your initial expectations?
* Use your early expectations to help frame what you've discovered through the research process
	* I believed that [hypothesis], but we discovered that [research finding] 

* Things to ask yourself?
	* Does what I've learned change the original research objective?
	* Is there a pattern in the data that suggests new design considerations?
	* What gaps in the research I have discovered that might need to be researched at a later date?


# Affinity Diagramming
## What is it?

* In a group its sorting through the research findings to find patterns and themes in the data
* Rapidly clarifies large quantities of data
* Helps the team perform a consensus about the meaning of the data and insights
* Gives a traceable link between data and insights

## How it works
* Take an inight from an interviewee and put it on a post-it note (single colour per interviewee)
* All caps (so its legible)
* The insight has to be something you observed (quote or behaviour)
* No solutioning allowed (don't assume you know what people need before defining the problem)
