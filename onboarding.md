# Storytelling
![Onboarding](/uploads/onboarding.png "Onboarding")

* The onboarding process is a form of storytelling. It's to help people understand why they need the product.
* It's an overview, so present it before the user does anything else
* Onboarding is not a substitute for good design. The product needs to be intuitive first and foremost.

Ask yourself:
* How long should my onboarding be?
* When should I prompt users to first sign up?
* What story should be my first time use experience to tell?

## How long should onboarding be?
* Depends on context, however a single splash screen and three onboarding screens is commonly used.
* Types of onboarding screens
	* Benefits orientated - Why should I use this? How does it fit into my life?
	* Function orientated - What can I do with this? How should I use it?
	* Progressive - Just try it out

## What story should my first-time user experience tell?
* Think of voice and tone
* What is going to make an emotional connection to the user?
* Getting people to care starts in a way that makes them feel understood

# Starting in a Null State
* Think of how to generate value for the user early in the process, so they have a reason to return
* Use this opportunity to let your experiences personality shine through
* Don't let the user face a blank screen when they first open the app. Think of ways to help get them started
