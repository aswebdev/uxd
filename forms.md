# Good Forms
* A good form is a conversation, not an interrogation.
* Try and see things from the **users** perspective, not the organisations or databases.
* Make it clear _why_ they need to answer each question 

# Best Practices

* Clear error messaging
* Forgive mistakes
* Show progress
* Let users tab

# Clear Communication

* Provide natuual breaks in the flow
* Indicate progress at key points
* Ask non-essential questions after the form is completed
* Auto-populate anything you can
