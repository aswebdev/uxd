# Good Forms
* A good form is a conversation, not an interrogation.
* Try and see things from the **users** perspective, not the organisations or databases.
* Make it clear _why_ they need to answer each question 

# Best Practices
* Clear communication
* Consider the context
* Clear error messaging
* Forgive mistakes
* Show progress
* Let users tab
