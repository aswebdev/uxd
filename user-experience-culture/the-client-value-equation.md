<!-- TITLE: The Client Value Equation -->

### What is client value?

> "Customer Value is the perception of what a product or service is worth to a Customer versus the possible alternatives. Worth means whether the Customer feels s/he or he got benefits and services over what s/he paid."

### Measurement for client value

In it's most simple form, the measurement for client value as follows:

> Client Value = Benefits - Cost 

### Creating better client value with UX

Offering a better user experience automatically provides an increased percieved value towards the organisation. Customers are more engaged and identify with the product.
The *cost to serve* also decreases with less resources spent on obtaining new clients, listening to customer problems and support. Value will be created in fewer marketing costs (there are more customer advocates) and a better understanding of what the customer actually needs, which allows focus on the correct problems.
