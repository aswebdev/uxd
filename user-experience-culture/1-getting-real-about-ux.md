<!-- TITLE: Getting Real About UX -->

### Redefine the customer relationship
* A better user experience is about better serving todays connected consumers. It's about *serving* not selling.
* True customer engagement is about listening to your users abd allowing them to reshape what is being delivered on a fundamental level

### Working across silos
* Creating a great user experience is only possible if the entire organisation works together
* Each person in the organisation needs to consider the impact of their work on customers if the company wants to create an outstanding experience

### Ensure commuication across silos
> "Silos - and the turd wars they enable - devastate organisations. They waste resources, kill productivity, and jeopardize the achievement of goals."

* The typical user experience spans many departments. They will interact with marketing, sales, finance, delivery and customer support

### How to start collaborating across silos
* Start by understanding what each team does and what they care about
* Take time to shadow collegues in other departments (spend a day with them as they do their jobs and ask a lot of questions)
* Engage with different types of people (not just the bosses)

#### Questions to consider
* Can you describe to me what you do, or what your job entails?
* What are the responsiblilities of your department?
* What does a typical day look like?
* What do you love most about your job?
* What contact (if any), do you have with customers?
* Are there any ways I could help make your job better?

* Stay in contact with the people you meet. Ask for their opinions and thoughts on different matters.
