<!-- TITLE: User Flows -->

# The Role of User Flows
User flows provide a more detailed guide from storyboards, as to the decisions that the user makes during the life-cycle of the interaction. A user flow is not specifically interface design decisions, it's any decision that the user needs to make.

# Benefits of User Flows
* Stops you from jumping straight into screen development
* Shows you what actually needs to be created from an interface perspective
* Uncovers any potenital problems with the users journey

# Think about
* Features rather than pages
* Not designing a page per feature
* A solid flow before jumping into prototypes

# Basic Shapes

# Multi-User Flows
Great for understanding flows with multiple participants involved

# Getting started
1. Determine which persona(s) you'll be designing for
2. Determine the user needs and business objectives
3. Something **AWESOME** that the user won't be expecting, but will love
4. Where is the user coming from? What is the entry point?


# Tips for User Flows
* Start with the simple *happy path* and add detail later
* Cover the flow that the user sees (not what happens behind the curtain)
