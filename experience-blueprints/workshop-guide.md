<!-- TITLE: Experience Blueprint - A Workshop Guide -->


**Introduction**

*Why is creating an experience blueprint valuable?*
* We can start to visualise key areas of our products/services and better understand the connections between client touchpoints, to the technologies and processes that we use behind the scenes.
* It will assist with discovering potential gaps, duplication and breakdowns in our product/service that currently exist.
* By building a consistent canvas template across the organisation, we can get alignment from top to bottom on how our product/service will function. 
* Give us complete understanding of our current state, so that we can better understand and then priorise the changes needed to move towards our ideal state
