<!-- TITLE: Experience Blueprint - A Workshop Guide -->


**Introduction**

*Why is creating an experience blueprint valuable?*
* We can start to visualise key areas of our products/services and better understand the connections between client touchpoints, to the technologies and processes that we use behind the scenes.
* It will assist with discovering potential gaps, duplication and breakdowns in our product/service that currently exist.
* By building a consistent canvas template across the organisation, we can get alignment from top to bottom on how our product/service will function. 
* Give us complete understanding of our current state, so that we can better understand and then priorise the changes needed to move towards our ideal future state

*Roadmap for moving towards the ideal future state*
1. *Current State Blueprint* - Development of the current state blueprint
2. *Alignment* - Present and discuss with key people involved in the process (ensure that everyone is aligned on the key activities)
3. *Future State Blueprint* - Development of the future state blueprint
4. *Project cards/How can we* - Define projects/[how could we](/defining-user-goals) statements for the key things that need to happen for moving to the ideal state
5. *Roadmap/Prioritisation* - Prioritise projects using [feature priorisation methods](/feature-prioritisation)

*Key concepts*
* Fontstage vs Backstage - Parts of the product/service visible to the client (fronstage) verus ones that are hidden (backstage)
* Swimlanes - Horizontal rows for organising particular aspects of the product/service (customer actions, touchpoints)
* Moments - Vertrical columns which encapsulate the activities happening at a given moment in the experience. 
* Stages - Used to group the particular phases of the experience, which help with overall structure of the product/service
* Flow lines - Indicate the direction of the interaction and connections between the different elements of the blueprint


**Building the current state blueprint**

*Key steps in building the current state blueprint*
1. Fill out the customer actions swimlane (helps put the customer as the key focus of the blueprint)
2. Work down each column and then across, filling out all the elements of the blueprint
3. Group the different stages
4. Direct the flow lines

*Customer actions*
