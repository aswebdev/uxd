# Why don't we just ask people what they want?
> "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." - Henry Ford

Learn to interpret what the users true problems are, instead of creating solutions based entirely on their answers. Ask the questions:
* What do they really need?
* How could we find that out?

# How are the users currently dealing with the problem?

# Conducting user interviews
**Define the research goals**
Make sure you put it into a research plan and share with your team to ensure that everyone is on the same page

**You may need to interview clients/stakeholders**
Do your clients know their research goals? Help them along by asking key questions to make sure you're researching the right subject.
