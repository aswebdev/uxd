# Why don't we just ask people what they want?
> "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." - Henry Ford

Learn to interpret what the users true problems are, instead of creating solutions based entirely on their answers. Ask the questions:
* What do they really need?
* How could we find that out?

# How are the users currently dealing with the problem?

# Conducting user interviews

### Planning the interview
**Define the research goals**
Make sure you put it into a research plan and share with your team to ensure that everyone is on the same page

**You may need to interview clients/stakeholders**
Do your clients know their research goals? Help them along by asking key questions to make sure you're researching the right subject.

**Prep a discussion guide**
This will guide your interviews and help you ask all the important topics you don't want to forget.

### The Interview

**Show a bland curiousity**
We are all informed by our own experiences, suspicions and what people have told you. Leave these at the door and come in with a _bland curiousity_

**Be hungry for the participants take on things**
Not only should you be ready to hear a participants take on things, you shoud be _hungry_ for it. Embrace this as a deliberate state

**Be aware of your body language**
* Make and maintain eye contact
* Lean forward and be visibly engaged

**Stage activities where possible**
Get the participant to demonstrate an activity, rather than tell you about it. It will give much more insight into how they complete a set of tasks

**Use their language and terminology**
Refer to concepts and objects the way that the participant does. Do not correct them explicitly or implicily

**Getting started**
* Thank the participant for their time
* At a high level, inform the participant what the interview is about
* Give a thumbnail overview of the interview process
* Ask them if they have any questions to start with
* Do not start too specifically, however be mindful when you move into the mode of asking questions

# Reviewing a user interview
* Does what I learned change the original objective?
* Is there a pattern in the data that suggests new design considerations?
* Are there gaps in knowledge that I've uncovered that I need to research later?

## Good user interview techniques
* Ask open ended questions
* Follow topics, not specific questions
* Be a good listener
* You are the apprentice (they are the expert)
* Ask for experiences (rather than hypotheticals)
* Encourage stories
* Ask them to demonstrate
* Don't seek confirmation
* Don't fear silence
* Never prosume that the participant accepts your world view

## Palette of Question Types

**Questions that gather context and details**
* Ask about sequence - "How do you describe a typical work day?"
* Ask about quantity - "How many files would you delete in a session?"
* Ask about specific examples - "Tell me about the last movie you streamed?"
* Ask about exceptions - "Tell me about a time that the customer had a problem?"
* Ask about relationships - "How do you work with new vendors?"

**Questions that probe whats been unsaid**
* Ask for clarification - "When you refer to that, are you talking about the newest model?"
* Ask about native language - "Why do you refer to it as _the bat cave_?"
* Ask about emotional cues - "What made you laugh when you refered to Microsoft?"
* Probe delicately - "You mentioned this difficult situation, tell me about that situation?"
