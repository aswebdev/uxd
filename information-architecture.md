<!-- TITLE: Information Architecture -->

# What is it?
> **Information Architecture** is the way we arrange the parts of something to make it understandable - [Abby Covert](https://twitter.com/abby_the_ia)

It making our information:
* Findable
* Usable
* Clear

# Card sorting
Cart sorting is a way of finding patterns in how users would expect to find content or functionality.


## 1. What do you want to learn?

Focus of the research:
* Structuring navigation?
* Categorising content?
* Troubleshooting?

## 2. Select your information and make cards

Choose the information:
* Existing content?
* Inventory Outputs?
* Brainstormed ideas?

## 3. Recruit people for the sort
* Who to recruit?
* How many to recruit?
* Multiple Groups? Group Sizes?

## 4. Facilitate the card sort
* Explain the process
* Give timings and start
* Observe and take notes
* Clarify but don't lead
* End the sort
* Have a short discussion with the groups
* Take photos
* Carefully collect the cards

## 5. Analyse the results
* What does the results tell us?
* What decisions need to be made in terms of our IA?


# Testing your IA
Card sorting tells us how people group things and make associations, however it's not the best way to tell if your IA helps them to complete tasks or find things.
