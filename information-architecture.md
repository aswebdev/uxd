<!-- TITLE: Information Architecture -->

# What is it?
> **Information Architecture** is the way we arrange the parts of something to make it understandable - [Abby Covert](https://twitter.com/abby_the_ia)

It making our information:
* Findable
* Usable
* Clear

# Card sorting
Cart sorting is a way of finding patterns in how users would expect to find content or functionality.


## 1. What do you want to learn?

Focus of the research:
* Structuring navigation?
* Categorising content?
* Troubleshooting?

## 2. Select your information and make cards

Choose the information:
* Existing content?
* Inventory Outputs?
* Brainstormed ideas?

## 3. Recruit people for the sort
* Who to recruit?
* How many to recruit?
* Multiple Groups? Group Sizes?

## 4. Facilitate the card sort
* Explain the process
* Give timings and start
* Observe and take notes
* Clarify but don't lead
* End the sort
* Have a short discussion with the groups
* Take photos
* Carefully collect the cards

## 5. Analyse the results
* What does the results tell us?
* What decisions need to be made in terms of our IA?


# Testing your IA
Card sorting tells us how people group things and make associations, however it's not the best way to tell if your IA helps them to complete tasks or find things.

[Tree testing software](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack) can assist with helping these research questions.


# Organising Information
Information can be organised by:
* Location
* Alphabetically
* Time
* Topic (e.g. Sport, Weather, Current Affairs)
* Audience (e.g. Personal, Business)
* Task (e.g. Book Flight, Book Hotel)

**Exact** - Location, Alphabetically, Time
**Ambiguous** - Topic, Audience, Task


# Understanding how users seek information
## Known-item
In a known-item the user:
* Knows what they want
* Knows what words to use to describe it
* May have a good understanding of where to start

> "Where do I find that Armani Jacket?"

Design approaches include:
* Search
* Navigation

## Exploratory
The user has some idea of what they need to know. However they may not know how to articulate it, and if they can, may not know the right words to use.

> "What options are available to invest my money in?"

Design approaches include:
* Browsable categories
* Associated items
* Suggestive Search

## Unknown
The key concept is that users don't know exactly what they need to know.

> "What do I need to do to organise a will?"

Design approaches include:
* Reccomendations
* Suggested Items

## Re-Finding
Users are looking for things they have already seen.

> "Where did I see that skateboard?"

Design approaches include:
* Personalisation
* Favourites
* Dynamic History
