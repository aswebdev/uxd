<!-- TITLE: Outcome framing -->

**What specifically do you want?**
* Must be positive (I want to.., rather than I don’t want to...)
* Must be within my control
* What will having this outcome do for me? (meta-outcome)

**How will you know when you’ve achieved what you want?**
* How soon do I want this outcome?

**Under what circumstances, where, when with whom do you want to have this result?**
* Try imagining what it will be like to achieve this goal
* What opportunities are there to ‘try it on’?
* How will this desired outcome affect my life?
* How will it affect family, finances, friends and work?

**What stops you from having this outcome already?**

**What resources will you need to help you create what you want?**
* What resources do I have?
* What resources do I need?

**How are you going to get there - and what is the first step to begin to achieve this result?**
* Draw up a roadmap to get the ball rolling
