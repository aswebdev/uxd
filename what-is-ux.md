# Why is User Experience Design important?
* **It increases customer satisfaction.** Customers have a better experience with our business, they become advocates and tell their family, friends and peers. Word of mouth is the marketing holy grail
* **It helps save money.** If assumptions get tested earlier, then time is saved on development costs. It's much more expensive finding a problem at launch or after launch, than finding it at sketching or prototyping stage.
* **It gives us insight and understanding into users problems** If we fully understand what the users problems are, then it becomes much easier to build a solution, rather than making assumptions.
* **It aligns user goals to business needs** Aligning user goals to business needs ensures that all stakeholders needs are being satisfied.
