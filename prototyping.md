![Why Prototype](/uploads/why-prototype.png "Why Prototype")

It's all about testing:
* Exploring ideas before you invest in them. Risk reduction.
* Communicates your intention to the team/stakeholders
* Verifies assumptions and answers open questions
* Saves time and resources
* Lets you test how users might *feel*


# Ask the questions?
* How much fiedelity do you need to test the idea?
* Whats the smallest increment of work you can do to learn what you need and more forward?
* Include real motion to make it look more real, to get the reaction you need in order to iterate.
